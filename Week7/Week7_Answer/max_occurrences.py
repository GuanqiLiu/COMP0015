Name: max_occurrences.py
Description:

This program contains a function called max_occurrences that accepts a list of integers as a parameter
and returns a key, value pair which are: the most frequently occurring integer and the number of times
the most frequently occurring integer (the "mode") occurs in the list. Solve this problem using a
dictionary. If the list is empty, return (0,0)..
