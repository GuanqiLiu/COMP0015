"""
Name: symmetric_set_difference.py
Description:

This program contains a function named 'symmetric_set_difference' which accepts 2 sets of integers as parameters.
The function returns a new set containing their symmetric set difference (that is, the set of elements contained in
either of the two sets but not in both). For example, the symmetric difference between the sets {1, 4, 7, 9} and
{2, 4, 5, 6, 7} is {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}.
